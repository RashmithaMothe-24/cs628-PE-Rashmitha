# PE05- RECIPE FINDER
Input: The input includes user-provided data such as recipe names, ingredients, and instructions. Users interact with a React-based frontend that allows them to add, view, update, and delete recipes. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles API requests, storing and retrieving recipe data from a MongoDB Atlas database.

Process: The frontend is built using React with React Router for navigation between different views. API calls are made to the Express backend, which processes requests and communicates with MongoDB. The backend includes routes for fetching all recipes, adding new ones, retrieving details, updating, and deleting them. Error handling and debugging messages were added to ensure smooth functionality. Finally, styling improvements were made using App.css for a better user experience.

Output: The final output is a fully functional Recipe Finder application where users can manage recipes efficiently. Recipes are stored and retrieved dynamically, with a user-friendly interface that allows seamless CRUD operations. The app is now structured, styled, and working as expected.
