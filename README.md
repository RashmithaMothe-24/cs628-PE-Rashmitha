Input: A list of films with each title, genre, year of release, and unique ID is accepted by the application. Users can interact with the program by selecting a movie title to view more details in an alert or by using a dropdown menu to filter the films by genre.

Process:The application manages the state of the chosen genre using hooks like useState and the component-based design of React. Depending on the chosen genre, the MovieList component creates the movie list dynamically. The movie list is instantly filtered to show only the films that fit the user's selected genre when they choose it from the dropdown menu. An event handler is triggered when a movie is clicked, displaying an alert with the title of the film.

Output:In the browser, the application displays a curated, easily navigable list of movies. Viewing movie details, filtering films by genre, and receiving visual confirmation of their pick through an alert are all available to users.
