Input: The application takes user input through a text field where users can enter task descriptions. Once a task is typed, clicking the "Add Task" button adds it to the list. Each task also has a "Delete" button to remove it when no longer needed. The input is managed using the useState hook in React.

Process: The app is built using React and follows a component-based architecture:
TodoApp.js handles the main logic, including state management and event handlers.
TodoList.js renders the list dynamically using .map().
TodoItem.js manages each task and its delete functionality. CSS is applied to ensure proper layout and styling.

Output: The final output is an interactive ToDo List where users can add and delete tasks dynamically.
