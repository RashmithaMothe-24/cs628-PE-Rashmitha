Input
A user's identity, contact information, education, talents, and employment history are among the data that the application collects.
Usually, this data is dynamically retrieved or structured in a Resume.js file. React is used by the App.js component to render the input information.

Process
The Resume component receives the incoming data and formats and arranges it for display. 
To guarantee a polished layout and design, Resume.css styles are used. Dynamic content and style can be seamlessly integrated with React's JSX and CSS modules.
During development, the React development server updates the output in real-time and compiles the code.

Ouput
The end result is a visually stunning and responsive resume that can be viewed in a web browser at localhost:3000. 
The resume displays all of the user-provided data in a well-structured format that is prepared for printing or distribution.
